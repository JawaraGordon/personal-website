              <em>The wonder years</em> <br />
              <br />
              During this decade I learned the basics of using DOS. I installed
              games and programs from floppy disk using a CLI. The mid-90's was
              when I truly began to explore the web after my family purchased
              our very first computer, a Compaq Presario. I got up to speed with
              Windows while learning OSX at school using an Apple IIe (that we
              all shared.)

              <em>Technical Skills</em> <br />
              <br />
              I decided to move to Orlando FL to attend Full Sail University.
              The knowledge I gained about the basics of digital design and
              audio engineering have continued to be a strong foundation
              throughout my life. The fundamentals of audio never change,
              although the way we use them continues to evolve. The same rules
              apply to the basics of HTML & CSS. My Web Dev journey had
              officially begun!

            <p>
              <em> MySpace has entered the chat...</em> <br />
              <br />
              Social media was on the rise during the mid-2000's. You had to
              have a seriously good (and tricked out) MySpace page to even think
              you were cool in the 00's. Learning how to edit CSS styles to add
              animation and color themes to your page was a vital skillset.

              <em>Full-Stack Parenting</em> <br />
              <br />
              During this time I was committed to starting a family, raising my
              son and growing my career as an audio engineer. I produced &
              recorded entire albums of music for myself and others while
              working professionally in the live sound industry. My DJ hobby
              slowly grew into a full-time career allowing me to perform at
              music festivals, nightclubs, and special events for some of the
              biggest organizations in the world. I was recruited to work as a
              booking agent for one of the most reputable agencies in Florida.
              During this time, I spearheaded a re-branding of the company which
              included full-stack web development using WordPress and SQL. Time
              was flying by until the pandemic changed everything. These
              industries were hit hard by the lock-down. I suddenly found myself
              with lots of time on my hands, looking for a change... I started
              to get back to my roots with computers. With so many options for
              learning, where do you even start?

              <br />
              <br />
              It was time to go back to school. I started by reading books and
              listening to podcasts all about software engineering & computer
              science. I didn't know what they were talking about most of the
              time but whenever I came to a new term, I would stop to reserach
              that topic. (JSON, by the way, is not a reference to the months in
              a year.) My plan was working, I decided to design Apps, make games
              and create art using code. I put pen to paper creating lots of
              layouts for products to develop. I learned the basics of Xcode &
              Swift but quickly came to a dead-end. My designs were great but
              where do I keep all this data? It was time to learn about the
              full-stack!

              <br />
              I understood the basics of frontend design while starting to grasp
              what was going on behind the scenes. I realized it was time to
              take my education to the next level. There's an endless amount of
              programs out there offering to take you to the promised land. What
              path should I take? After careful consideration I decided the best
              path forward was to become a "Full Stack Web Developer." This
              would allow me to obtain a job in a growing industry without a CS
              degree. I decided that Bootcamps were the best option but which
              one?

              <em>A New Challenger Approaches...</em> <br />
              <br />
              I was feeling conflicted about which Bootcamp to take. I was
              hoping to find something close to home that I could also attend in
              person. That's when I found the SCF Coding BootCamp Powered by
              Flatiron School. This was <strong>PERFECT!</strong> I jumped at
              the chance to learn about this new program while working hard to
              find the resources to join. Everything I've learned so far in life
              has prepared me for this moment.

              I'm proud of myself for going back to school to change careers.
              Now it's time to apply the skills I've acquired to finding my
              first job as a Full Stack Web Developer. It's my goal to work for
              an established company that challenges me to continue growing as a
              software engineer while allowing me to pursue my passion of making
              the world a better place with code.

              <br />
              After many rounds of interviews, take home coding challenges,
              calls with hiring managers, CTOs, PMs, Senior Devs, and business
              owners I received four job offers! I was able to narrow my
              decision down to two companies, ultimately making one of the
              toughest decisions of my life. <br />
              <br />Iâ€™m very happy with the choice I made and excited to
